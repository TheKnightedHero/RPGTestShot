The current project idea is to develop a basic text-based RPG game. From there,
i want to move on and develop a skeleton of the game in code, where i can simply
replace the story text files, and still have the game work, thus having only the need to write the game itself once,
but have multiple stories that can work off of it.

I plan on first starting all this code out in C++ since I am currently most familiar with it
    -I plan on creating this in C# and Java, storing each version in a separate folder


prototype until i can get into VS

class characters
{
    string race; 
    string playerClass;
//The two variables above might actually be of type class not type string 
/*
    Race race;
    PlayerClass playerClass;
*/

    int strength;
    int Dexterity;
    int intelligence;
    int wisdom;
    int Charisma;


};

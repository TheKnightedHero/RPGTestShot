I plan on first starting all this code out in C++ since I am currently most familiar with it
    -I plan on creating this in C# and Java, storing each version in a separate folder


prototype until i can get into VS

class characters
{
    string race; 
    string playerClass;
//The two variables above might actually be of type class not type string 
/*
    Race race;
    PlayerClass playerClass;
*/

    int strength;
    int Dexterity;
    int intelligence;
    int wisdom;
    int Charisma;


};

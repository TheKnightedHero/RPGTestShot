# RPGTestShot
My first shot at developing a text based RPG utilizing programming concepts learned from my CS classes.


The current project idea is to develop a basic text-based RPG game. From there,
i want to move on and develop a skeleton of the game in code, where i can simply
replace the story text files, and still have the game work, thus having only the need to write the game itself once,
but have multiple stories that can work off of it.

I plan on first starting all this code out in C++ since I am currently most familiar with it
    -I plan on creating this in C# and Java, storing each version in a separate folder

for now, most of the guts for the classes will just simply be written inside the playercharacter class. 
    -Inheritance can designed after i have written my ideas down inside this class
